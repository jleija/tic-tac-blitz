# Tic-Tac-Blitz

Tic-Tac-Blitz is an online, one-screen, multi-board, tic-tac-toe game.

This is a little experiment project to learn Svelte. It helped me explore Svelte components, its events and pocketbase API.

## Requirements

Tic-Tac-Blitz requires [here](https://github.com/jleija/tic-tac-blitz-pb) as its pocketbase-powered backend.

Depends on Svelte + TS + Vite.

## How to run it

Use `npm run dev` to run it.
